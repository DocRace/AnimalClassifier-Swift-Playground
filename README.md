All for Swift Playgrounds!. Use Create ML to Train Model and Core ML to recognize animal species in Swift Playground on iPad.  完全在 Swift Playgrounds 实现的工程！使用 Create ML 框架训练机器学习模型，Core ML 框架使用模型在 iOS Playground 环境中让 iPad 来识别动物种类！

## Features
- Create ML
- Core ML

## How to use Core ML in swift Playground
Playground don't recognize .mlmodel file by default, so we need a iOS Project to help us find the compiled mlmodelc folder, and copy the mlmodelc folder to playground's resourse folder, and the auto generated helper class to playground's sourse folder and change it to public. Then it works!
